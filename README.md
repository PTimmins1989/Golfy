# Golfy
My final year college project

I created an android app back in 2013 as part of my final year project. It was a golfing application which provided information on Players, Tournaments and Golf courses throughout the world. All data was dynamically pulled from the backend of a AWS website as XML and presented in the app. It had facebook integration for sharing commenting etc and also had a GPS feature for golf courses nearby etc.
